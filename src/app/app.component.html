            <h2>1. What is SlaynRookers?</h2>
              <p>Is an open source project (you can also contribute) with the aim of creating a community for the residents of Rookgaard in Slaynville.</p>
            <h2>2. Why contribute?</h2>
              <p>We believe that a portal to integrate all rookgaard residents would be of great value. We see several possibilities for an open place to share adventures, make exchanges, stay up to date with news and much more.

If you are a technology enthusiast, it would be an excellent experience to be part of a real open source project and deal with the challenges of a project in production.</p>
            <h2>3. How can I contribute?</h2>
              <p>At the moment all types of contributions are welcome.

We need creative minds to help us design the future of SlaynRookers, we would like to add a lot of information beyond Highscores.

We need developers (back end and front end) ranging from simple tasks, such as design improvements, to more complex tasks. Any kind-hearted developer is welcome :) experienced or not.</p>
